## About this Project

I did this project with the aim of challenging myself with the development of a satisfactory portfolio without any framework. As I liked the result, I decided to use it as my personal portfolio and present some of my projects through it.

**See the project [here](https://gustavobrian08.github.io)!**

## Why?

This portfolio is also a project that aims to present my work. Therefore, it would be extremely rewarding for me if you could provide me with feedback on the project, code, structure, or any other aspect that could help me evolve as a developer! It would also help if you give it a star, thanks!

## Some Observations

1 - The translate button is not working (yet), it will serve to switch the language of the page between English and Portuguese.

2 - I am still unsure about how I will classify the technologies that I will be adding, so there may be changes to the categories.

## Responsivity

![](https://github.com/GustavoBrian08/gustavobrian08.github.io/blob/main/img/github/mob-details.gif)

I developed the project without thinking about responsiveness because the initial goal was only for study purposes, so I made it responsive only after almost the entire project was developed. As a result, there may be some resolutions where it is not 100% satisfactory.
